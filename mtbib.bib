	abstract = {Elastomers are of interest for use as deformation elements in pressure and force sensors. In this paper, a custom designed programmable elastomer test rig ({PETR}) developed in order to allow the routine mechanical evaluation (compression mode) of small elastomer structures (0.3–30 mm thick) is described and characterized. The mechanical properties of two polyurethane and two silicone rubbers were investigated using the {PETR}. Silastic silicone (Dow Corning 9161) was found to display relatively low hysteresis and good elasticity. More in-depth investigation of this material revealed that the elastic modulus and the hysteresis were independent of the amount of catalyst used in its preparation over the range 2–6\% (w/w). The Zener model was found to provide a good representation of the actual stress–strain behaviour of test specimens subjected to load–unload tests at strain rates in the range 1.25–60\% min−1 (load rates 4–200 N min−1) and dynamic tests at frequencies in the range 0.001–0.1 Hz. The combined hysteresis and creep for a 1 h test period was not greater than 4\%, with the creep contribution being up to 2.3\% and occurring in a manner predicted by the Zener model. Specimen form-factor strongly inﬂuenced both the elastic modulus and the hysteresis. Increasing the form-factor from 0.5 to 2.6 increased the elastic modulus from about 3.0 to 7.6 {MPa} while also increasing the hysteresis from 2.4\% to 25.2\%.},

	abstract = {In cross country skiing the technical equipment of an athlete constitutes a substantial part of the total performance. Thus, the focus of this study was (1) to determine if different Norwegian national athletes select Classic skis with similar characteristics and (2) to describe the key parameters for the two ski categories (warm and cold). Classic cross country skis (205 pairs) from the Norwegian men's and women's national ski teams were tested under lab conditions. Clear differences between various factors (camber height at the balance point, stiffness, length of contact zone and opening characteristics) were found. Lower camber height for cold skis and higher ones for warm skis can be explained by the wax routines and their necessities. The nominal contact zones for both men's and women's skis from the warm category are shorter than corresponding contact zones from skis of the cold category.},
